# Short-Project - Human-Activity-Regocnition

The goal of this project was to develop various classifiers that detect human actions (walking, sitting, waving...) by using x-, y- and z-coordinates of human joints.

A novel approach for human activity recognition using a new combination of
euclidean distance and area features to implement a robust
3D skeleton estimation from Kinect data is presented. Our dataset is
composed of 200 3D sequences of 10 indoor activities
performed by 10 individuals in varied views. Two approaches
are presented: a time-variant approach where the
extracted features are time-depending and a time-invariant
approach where the calculation of the mean and the
standard deviation make the features time-independent.
Finally a comparison between the two methods is made
checking the accuracy value of different classifiers.
